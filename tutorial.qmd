title: Forecasting Made Simple: A Guide to Time Series Modeling Using the Prophet Package in Python
---

## Introduction
  Time series forecasting is used everywhere in modern analytics. From sales and web traffic to weather and energy usage, times series is essential to many different businesses and modeling techniques. Although the prominence, forecasting can be intimidating if you are new to modeling. 

  Prophet, a package created by a team of Facebook Data Scientists, is a python library that is designed to be used by anyone with basic understanding of python. It handles trends, seasonality, trends, and missing values with very easy utility. This makes it a reliable and easier method for those who want to forecast without intense statistical theory. 

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

- Prepare your data for Prophet
- Fit your first forecasting model
- Visualize predictions and components
- Validate the model using residual diagnostics
- Extend the model with seasonality and holidays

## Installing and Importing Prophet
In the command line:
pip install prophet

Load the packages needed:
```python
from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf
import scipy.stats as stats
```
Prophet expects a dataframe with two columns:

- ds <- dates
- y <-  numeric values to forecast

## Loading and Preparing The Data
```python
df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")

# Prophet requires:
# ds = date column
# y  = numeric target
df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ds'])
df = df[['ds', 'y']]
df.head()
```

Prophet needs the dates to be a date object.
It must also be in the format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS

## Fitting the Prophet Model
The Prophet model is as follows:

\[
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + $\varepsilon$_t
\]

Where:

- \( g(t) \) is the trend  
- \( s(t) \) is seasonality  
- \( h(t) \) is the holiday effect  
- \( \varepsilon_t \) is the error term  

Creating and fitting the model only takes two lines:
```python
m = Prophet()
m.fit(df)
```

Prophet automatically models:

- nonlinear trend
- weekly seasonality
- yearly seasonality

You can customize these later.

## Creating a Future Dataframe
```python
future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)  # forecast 30 days ahead
future.tail()
```

This creates a dataframe with all historical dates plus 30 new ones.

## Generating Forecast
```python
forecast = m.predict(future)
forecast[['ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper']].tail()
```

### Prophet Output
Table of expected output from the Prophet forecast model:

| Column        | Meaning                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ds`          | Date of the forecast                         |
| `yhat`        | Predicted value                              |
| `yhat_lower`  | Lower bound of uncertainty interval          |
| `yhat_upper`  | Upper bound of uncertainty interval          |
| `trend`       | Estimated long‑term trend component          |
| `weekly`      | Weekly seasonal effect                       |
| `yearly`      | Yearly seasonal effect                       |


## 7. Visualizing the Forecast
Prophet includes built‑in plotting functions.

### Forecast plot
```python
fig1 = m.plot(forecast)
plt.title("Prophet Forecast")
plt.show()
```
### Trend and seasonality components
```python
fig2 = m.plot_components(forecast)
plt.show()
```
This breaks the model into:

- overall trend
- weekly seasonality
- yearly seasonality

These components help you understand why the model predicts what it does.

Here is an example of a forecast plot:

## Validity of Model
As with every regression model, assumptions should still be evaluated and met using the **LINE** assumptions (Linear, Independent, Normal, Equal Variance)

There are numerous ways to evaluate these diagnostics, so they will not be covered in this tutorial, but all assumptions should be reasonably met in order to validate forecasting predictions. 

Cross-validation should also be considered to evalutate this models predictive power and accuracy.

## Feature Engineering: Adding Seasonality or Holidays (Optional Enhancements)
Prophet makes it easy to feature engineer. You can add any amounts of different time varaibles to analyze the data for different time periods. These include holidays, seasons, trends, lags, etc. 

To add holiday's:
```python
m = Prophet()
m.add_country_holidays(country_name='US')
m.fit(df)
```
For seasonality:
```python
m = Prophet()
m.add_seasonality(name='monthly', period=30.5, fourier_order=5)
m.fit(df)
```
These additions can help improve accuracy of model especially when there are known patterns in your data

### Conclusion
  The Prophet package is a very versitile and easy to understand forecasting tool. This package allows to do a lot of complex statistical theory and analysis in only a few lines of code. It can help to look at time series data and find patterns and discern trends to allow for statistical analysis that is easily accesbile. Walking through all of the setup, importing, and analysis we can see the meaningful impact this package has for time series analysis. More importantly, you now have a workflow you can adapt to your own datasets—whether you’re analyzing sales, website traffic, or any other time‑indexed process. 
  
  To put this workflow into practice, try one of the following next steps:

- Apply the Prophet workflow to your own time‑stamped dataset, even if it’s something simple like daily counts or personal tracking data.
- Experiment with adding holidays or custom seasonalities to see how domain knowledge changes the shape and accuracy of your forecast.
- Compare Prophet’s predictions to a simple baseline model, such as a moving average or naive “last value” forecast, to build intuition about when Prophet adds value.
- Explore another forecasting library such as **statsmodels** or **scikit‑learn**, and compare its predictions to Prophet to build intuition about when each tool performs best.
