    "text": "Feature Engineering: Adding Seasonality or Holidays (Optional Enhancements)\nProphet makes it easy to feature engineer. You can add any amounts of different time variables to analyze the data for different time periods. These include holidays, seasons, trends, lags, etc.\nTo add holiday’s:\nm = Prophet()\nm.add_country_holidays(country_name='US')\nm.fit(df)\nFor seasonality:\nm = Prophet()\nm.add_seasonality(name='monthly', period=30.5, fourier_order=5)\nm.fit(df)\nThese additions can help improve accuracy of model especially when there are known patterns in your data\n\nConclusion\nThe Prophet package is a very versatile and easy to understand forecasting tool. This package allows to do a lot of complex statistical theory and analysis in only a few lines of code. It can help to look at time series data and find patterns and discern trends to allow for statistical analysis that is easily accessible. Walking through all of the setup, importing, and analysis we can see the meaningful impact this package has for time series analysis. More importantly, you now have a workflow you can adapt to your own datasets—whether you’re analyzing sales, website traffic, or any other time‑indexed process.\nTo put this workflow into practice, try one of the following next steps:\n\nApply the Prophet workflow to your own time‑stamped dataset, even if it’s something simple like daily counts or personal tracking data.\nExperiment with adding holidays or custom seasonalities to see how domain knowledge changes the shape and accuracy of your forecast.\nCompare Prophet’s predictions to a simple baseline model, such as a moving average or naive “last value” forecast, to build intuition about when Prophet adds value.\nExplore another forecasting library such as statsmodels or scikit‑learn, and compare its predictions to Prophet to build intuition about when each tool performs best."
